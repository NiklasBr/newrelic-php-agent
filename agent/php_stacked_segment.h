/*
 * Stacked segments
 *
 * php_execute.c explicitly warns about using stack space
 * in an excessive way - nevertheless with stacked segments we do exactly
 * that: adding a segment struct to the stack for every php_execute call
 * frame.
 *
 * The reason for this is, that having temporary segments on the stack
 * gives us a considerable performance advantage. The usual workflow for
 * starting a segment looks like this at the time of this writing.
 *
 *  - nr_segment_start
 *    - 2 obsolete if checks
 *    - nr_slab_next
 *      - 1 if check
 *      - vector size comparison
 *      - pointer return
 *    - nr_segment_init
 *      - 3 value changes
 *      - get start time
 *      - init children (2 value changes)
 *      - get current segment
 *      - set parent
 *      - set current segment
 *
 * Here's what happens when a segment is discarded. Note that this is
 * the _best_ case, as this is a segment without children and metrics.
 *
 *   - nr_segment_discard
 *     - 4 if checks
 *     - retire current segment
 *     - check metrics size
 *     - remove segment from parent vector
 *     - reparent children (3 if checks)
 *     - de-init children
 *     - destroy fields
 *     - nr_slab_release
 *       - zero-out segment
 *
 * As a comparision, here's the basic outline of what happens when using stacked
 * segments. Stacked segment alloc/dealloc for overwite execute paradigm handled
 * by c stack behind the scenes Stacked segment alloc/dealloc for OAPI paradigm
 * handled manually. Also for the best case.
 *
 *   - nr_php_stacked_segment_init        - nr_php_stacked_segment_discard
 *     - 3 value changes                    - reparent children (3 if checks)
 *     - get start time                     - 1 if check for segment->id
 *     - init children (2 value changes)    - 1 value change
 *
 * This simplified behavior saves us a lot, as especially in real-world
 * applications we are dealing with lots of short running segments that
 * are immediately discarded. Speeding up the segment init/discard cycle
 * is crucial for improving the performance of the agent.
 *
 * Additionally the ordered nature of the stack segment provides additional
 * benefits when dealing with the increased likelihood of dangling segments in
 * OAPI.
 *
 * There are some additional functionalities/checks added for OAPI however those
 * would need to be done regardless of where the segment is located so are not
 * added for comparison.
 *
 * What enables us to eliminate much of the work done in the
 * nr_segment_start/nr_segment_discard cycle:
 *
 *  - Not using the parent stacks on the transaction, but using pointers
 *    between stacked segments to determine the current active segment.
 *  - Not having segments go in and out of the slab allocator.
 *  - Functions are optimized to the context in which they are called.
 *    They are only called for segments that have no metrics, so we assume
 *    the metrics vector is not initialized.
 *  - We avoid lots of sanity if-checks happening throughout the
 *    nr_segment_* call stack.
 *  - Effective destroying due to context. Only segment->id can reasonably be
 *    allocated for segments we're dealing with here. No other nr_free
 *    calls are needed.
 *
 * The workflow of using stacked segments in connection with regular
 * segments is complicated. It's best illustrated by a short ASCII
 * cartoon.

 * *B gets discarded, and *A is the current segment again. *C gets

 *
 * In a next exciting step, stacked segment *D is started as child of *A and *E
 * is started as child of *D.

 *
 * Note that with this workflow, we went through the

 * Dangling segments:
 * With the use of Observer API we have the possibility of dangling segments.  In

 * nr_php_observer_fcall_begin starting segments and nr_php_observer_fcall_end
 * keeping/discarding/ending segments. However, in the case of an uncaught
 * exception, nr_php_observer_fcall_end is never called and therefore, the logic
 * to keep/discard/end the segment doesn't automatically get initiated.
 * Additionally, PHP only provides the last exception (meaning if exceptions
 * were thrown then rethrown or another exception thrown, nothing gets
 * communicated except for the last exception. PHP has a hook that can be used
 * to notify whenever an exception is triggered but it doesn't give any
 * indication if that exception was ever caught.
 *
 * To handle this, dangling exception sweeps occur in
 * nr_php_observer_exception_segments_end and is called from 5 different places:
 * 1) nr_php_observer_fcall_begin - before a new segment starts
 * 2) nr_php_observer_fcall_end - before a segment is ended(kept/discarded)
 * 3) nr_php_stacked_segment_unwind - when a txn ends and we are closing up shop
 * 4) php_observer_handle_exception_hook - when a new exception is noticed
 * 5) in newrelic APIs that depend on having the current segment
 *
 *
 * The workflow of using stacked segments in connection with regular
 * segments when an exception occurs is complicated.
 * These cases are illustrated by a series of short ASCII cartoons.
